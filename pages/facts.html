      <h2>Russian Napoleon Cake</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.slurrp.com/article/is-it-french-or-is-it-russian-the-history-of-napoleon-cake-is-quite-layered-1643628856585">

        <p>In 1912, the first iteration of the cake was crafted to honor <br>
        the 100th anniversary of the country's victory over Napoleon <br>
        and his troops. Initially, the cake was much smaller: a single-serve,<br>
        cream-filled pastry crafted to resemble the defeated Frenchman's <br>
        triangular bicorne.

        <p>One of the most beloved traditional pastries in East and Southeast Asia,<br>
          mooncakes are synonymous with the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, a holiday <br>
          that falls on the full moon, i.e., the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. <br>
          (In the Gregorian calendar, the date is typically in late September or early October.)

      <h2>Tembleque</h2>
      <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Tembleque"><img src="../images/tembleque.jpg" width="100", height="150" alt="Tembleque"/></a>
        <p>
          The name tembleque means wiggly, referring to a slight wiggle when the pudding <br>
          is shaken. This rich dessert can also be flavored with vanilla, nutmeg, or rum, <br>
          if desired. It is especially popular at birthday parties and similar festive <br>
          occasions.
